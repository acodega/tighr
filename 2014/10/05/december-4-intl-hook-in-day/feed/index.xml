The Northumberland Rug Hookers in Cobourg, Ontario  have finished our &quot;labor of love&quot;, our friendship  rug celebrating the International Day of Rug Hooking which started on Dec. 4, 2014 and is now complete.  I am so proud and so grateful to all of our members for the hours they spent on this amazing story rug.  One of our member put her hand on the rug but passed away a week after we started so each of us pulled a few loops in her honour.  This is a very special rug and we will use it when we demonstrate at events during the year.I am not sure how I can send you a photo but I will try.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The Northumberland Rug Hookers of Cobourg, Ontario, Canada are celebrating on Dec. 4th by starting a friendship rug with all the small town groups from the surrounding areaWe will design a creative rug of hands that will be passed from group to group with a completion day in May 2015 at our year end monthly meeting.  This is an exciting project that will bring together many new and experienced rug hookers and I imagine take on a life of it&#039;s own.  We will definitely send photos of the rug in various forms until completion!]]></description>

We are looking for file images to upload ahead of time as promo.  As used in the post on Oct 5. Also if someone has an event ahead of time we can include the image and caption on the day for fuller presence. Hope you and the group in Ottawa have some images to submit ahead or on the 4th.]]></description>
