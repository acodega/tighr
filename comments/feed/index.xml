					<description><![CDATA[Florence O&#039;Meara  was my  Mother.   She loved rug hooking  and was known as the &quot;Happy Hooker&quot;.  She made many wonderful rugs and all her friends had at least one to remember her by.   She had a wonderful life and  lived until she was 98 yeas old in Vanderhoof.
I was pleased to see your rug of  Sinkut Mountain.  Thank you,   Patricia]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I’ve been wandering around Pinterest looking for tapestry inspiration and saw this. I thought “wow, this is so west coast...then I thought ...looks familiar....hmm a bit like Race Rocks...  Then I looked further and saw that it is Race Rocks!
Beautifully done. Are you in Nanaimo? I’m in Chemainus. Great depth and texture...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was in Nova Scotia two summers ago and fell in love with this art form.  Have done nothing more then admire the work of others.  Thinking after I finish...... I came across this piece of yours.  I was absolutely delighted first with it, second with your subject matter.  I grew up with the view of sinkut mountain.  Saw through the frame of our living room window.  I have two rugs from a woman named Florence o’meara who lived in vanderhoof.  I didn’t totally appreciate them until I saw them as part of a wider movement.  It is so wonderful that someone is still hooking there.  Caroline lowther]]></description>

Dear Molly,
If you&#039;ve read any of the other comments, you&#039;ll see that the information has not yet been released. The pages have been created to share with the board and the teachers. The full Triennial programme of classes will go out to members in the November edition of &lt;em&gt;Hooking Matters&lt;/em&gt; and the password-protected pages will be made public soon afterwards.
Sorry for the frustration - not long to wait now...
Kind regards,
Lesley]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/05/monday-at-triennial/#comment-7405&quot;&gt;Lynda Kinnard&lt;/a&gt;.

Hi Lynda,
We would love to see the four of you in Swaledale next October and yes - you must be members to attend the Triennial.
We will be releasing full information about the event, including full details of the workshops and the costs, in the next TIGHR Newsletter (due out in November) and, if you join soon, you will be able to get the facts before non-members. If not, keep an eye on these pages: soon after members get the information, it will be released to the world!
With kind regards,
Lesley]]></description>

Hi Deb,
Don&#039;t worry! I made a mistake when I said Easter 2017 - it should have been 2018, of course!
Please feel free to contact the membership chair for further details about joining.
Kind regards,
