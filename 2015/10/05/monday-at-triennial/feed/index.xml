					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/10/05/monday-at-triennial/#comment-7405&quot;&gt;Lynda Kinnard&lt;/a&gt;.

Hi Lynda,
We would love to see the four of you in Swaledale next October and yes - you must be members to attend the Triennial.
We will be releasing full information about the event, including full details of the workshops and the costs, in the next TIGHR Newsletter (due out in November) and, if you join soon, you will be able to get the facts before non-members. If not, keep an eye on these pages: soon after members get the information, it will be released to the world!
With kind regards,
Lesley]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We are 4 Rug Hooker&#039;s and would like to come to the TIGHR next October. We understand we have to be members. Wondered what the additional costs are for attending the Conference? 
Heather Ritchie has invited me to put up our rug hooking display at the conference. 
Looking forward to hearing from you .
