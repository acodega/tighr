<p>TIGHR members&#8217; work were reviewed to create the new <a title="Gallery theme PORTRAITS" href="///gallery/" target="_blank">gallery theme PORTRAIT</a>S at <a title="TIGHR.net/gallery" href="///gallery" target="_blank">TIGHR.net/gallery</a>   Countries represented include Australia, Canada, Spain, the United Kingdom and United States. Juror Lori LaBerge describes the process in her statement:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000080;">&#8220;The jurying process can be an intimidating one. The reason I enjoyed jurying the TIGHR Gallery page is that it was a different procedure than usual. Whereas artists usually apply to have their work juried and shown, this procedure was based on my looking at all art photos on the TIGHR site. The process did away with artists having to worry about entry procedures, professional photo costs, jurying fees, and possible letters of refusal, yet allows their work to be part of the jurying process.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;">In choosing work for “The Portrait” I looked at skill, composition, creativity and how the artist communicated a sense of emotion for the viewer to experience. A further goal was to include a variety of work. I wanted to include artists who portrayed the portrait both traditionally and in a non-traditional fashion. The reason for this was to show the public the various ways the portrait can be presented as well as inspire artists to think differently about how they could portray the portrait in their own work.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;">I looked at whether a piece drew my eye to it or not. A clear intention for the creation of the work was taken into consideration. Did the work lead me to think about what the artist was trying to say? In creating a portrait, the eyes are everything. Are they expressing or hiding emotion? Could an abstract piece still convey expression? Could I look into the eyes and feel something?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;">Thank you to all of the artists who display their work on the TIGHR members site. There is a vast amount of talent within the group. We all learn from each other. TIGHR is a great venue to allow rug hooking artists to interact with and learn from others while introducing rug hooking as art to the public. &#8220;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Thank you,</span></strong><br />
