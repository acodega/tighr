G&#039;day Linda!
There is an Australian Rugmakers Guild -  http://www.rughookingaustralia.com.au/ - where you can find info about what we are doing and membership info ($10/yr). You will find that some TIGHR members are also ARG members (Jo Franco, Judith Stepehns, Susan Feller, and myself for example). Do consider joining the Australian Guild...things are different here in Oz and our approach is very &quot;Australian&quot;....we&#039;d love to have you as a member. Take a look at this public site (both the public and member site will be revised by the end of this year) and you can download information and some of our newsletters.
Do keep in touch!
Regards,
Judi Tompkins (Queensland)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello Linda
I live in Loch, in the South Gippsland region of Victoria and have recently started the fabulous art/craft of rughooking. I love it and have nearly completed my second wall hanging. I am looking forward to attending a couple of the workshops in Strathalbyn in Ocober. Maybe we will see you there? You are also very welcome to come to my home in Loch any time.
Regards

Hi Linda,
I don&#039;t believe we have a guild in Victoria, there are only a few rug hookers scattered far apart in Victoria. I do have Miriam and Jacqui coming to stay for a few days&#039; visit in February, and wondered if you would like to join us, you&#039;re very welcome to stay here. Would love to hear from you.
