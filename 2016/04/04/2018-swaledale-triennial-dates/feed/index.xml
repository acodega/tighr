Hi Pat,
We will be publishing full details of the Triennial events in the November issue of &lt;em&gt;Hooking Matters&lt;/em&gt;. Shortly afterwards, full information will appear on the TIGHR website.
We look forward to meeting you and your husband in Swaledale - there will be events for non-participants too!
Regards,
Lesley]]></description>

Hi Deb,
Don&#039;t worry! I made a mistake when I said Easter 2017 - it should have been 2018, of course!
Please feel free to contact the membership chair for further details about joining.
Kind regards,
Lesley]]></description>

Hi Roasario,
As I explained in the email I sent via Ning, I am unable to edit any member&#039;s details. Only the member can do that.
As a compromise, I have sent an invitation to join to your new address. I have also edited your message (above) to avoid the possibility of attracting &#039;spam&#039; to your new address.
With kind regards,
Lesley]]></description>
