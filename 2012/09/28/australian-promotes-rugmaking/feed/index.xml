					<description><![CDATA[Hi from a new Australian rug hooker
How wonderful to be at the bottom rung here in Australia and have the privelege to pass this beautiful art form on to others. I belong to a bible study group and a lady commented on my second only, finished rug and said how beautiful it was. She also said that she used to do rug hooking back in the 1950s. I was amazed. It seems it has been around, but not promoted for a long time. It&#039;s time we came out of the closet and do just that. Good on you Judi. If I was in the neighbourhood I&#039;d come and support you. Unfortunately I am in Victoria, but hope to meet you in Strathalbyn.
